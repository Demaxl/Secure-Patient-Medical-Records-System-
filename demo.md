# Medical Records System - Demonstration Guide

## Quick Start

The Medical Records System is now fully implemented and tested. Here's how to use it:

### 1. Build the Solution

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run --project src/MedicalRecords
```

## Default Login Credentials

| Username | Password   | Role   | Permissions                             |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| admin1   | Admin@123  | Admin  | Full access to all operations           |
| doctor1  | Doctor@123 | Doctor | Can manage patients and medical records |
| nurse1   | Nurse@123  | Nurse  | Read-only access to patient data        |

## System Features Demonstrated

### Proxy Pattern Implementation

-   **PatientRepositoryProxy**: Controls access to patient data based on user role
-   **MedicalRecordRepositoryProxy**: Controls access to medical records based on user role

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

-   **Admin**: Can perform all operations including deletions
-   **Doctor**: Can add/update patients and medical records, but cannot delete
-   **Nurse**: Read-only access to patient information and medical records

### Security Features

-   BCrypt password hashing for secure authentication
-   Comprehensive audit logging of all operations
-   Thread-safe JSON data storage with file locking

### Data Persistence

-   JSON-based data storage for portability
-   Automatic database initialization with sample data
-   Thread-safe operations for concurrent access

## Sample Operations

### As a Doctor:

1. Login with `doctor1` / `Doctor@123`
2. Search for patients
3. Add new patients
4. Update patient information
5. Add medical records
6. View medical records

### As a Nurse:

1. Login with `nurse1` / `Nurse@123`
2. Search for patients
3. View patient information
4. View medical records
5. Cannot modify any data

### As an Admin:

1. Login with `admin1` / `Admin@123`
2. All Doctor and Nurse operations
3. Delete patients
4. Delete medical records
5. Full system access

## Architecture Highlights

-   **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with Models, Data, Services, and Security layers
-   **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected into the CLI and proxies
-   **Interface Segregation**: Repository interfaces define clear contracts
-   **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a single, well-defined purpose
-   **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to extend with new roles or permissions

## Testing Coverage

The system includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

-   ✅ Authentication and authorization
-   ✅ Proxy pattern behavior
-   ✅ CRUD operations
-   ✅ Search functionality
-   ✅ Role-based access control
-   ✅ Error handling

All tests pass successfully, ensuring the system works as designed.

## Next Steps

To extend the system, you could:

1. Add new user roles with different permissions
2. Implement additional data validation
3. Add more sophisticated search capabilities
4. Implement data encryption for sensitive information
5. Add a web-based interface
6. Implement real-time audit notifications

The Proxy pattern makes it easy to add new security rules without modifying existing business logic.
